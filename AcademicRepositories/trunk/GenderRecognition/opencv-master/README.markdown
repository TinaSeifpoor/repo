## eigenfaces ##

Eigenfaces implementation using the OpenCV2 C++ API. There's a very basic function for loading the dataset, you probably want to make this a bit more sophisticated. The dataset is available at [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html).

## lbp ##

Implements various Local Binary Patterns with the OpenCV2 C++ API:
  
* Original LBP
* Circular LBP (also known as Extended LBP)
* Variance-based LBP

Basic code for spatial histograms and histogram matching with a chi-square distance is included, but it's not finished right now. There's a tiny demo application you can experiment with.

## lda ##

Fisherfaces implementation with the OpenCV2 C++ API. Here's my [answer on stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7574623/c-face-detection-recognition-implementations/7864357#7864357) and here's my [blog post on Fisherfaces in OpenCV](http://www.bytefish.de/blog/fisherfaces_in_opencv). If you want some insights how this stuff works, you can read through [my post and experiments with Fisherfaces and Eigenfaces](http://www.bytefish.de/blog/fisherfaces).
