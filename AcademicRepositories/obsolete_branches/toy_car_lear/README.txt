This toy car dataset is created by the LEAR project, INRIA,
http://lear.inrialpes.fr.  It is intended to run experiments on Visual
Identification, or Identification from One Example. The purpose is to decide if
two images represent the same object or not.

The images are in the directory imstdsize/. They all have the same height.

The pairs of images are described in the file pairs.txt, one line per image
pair. The first two columns contain the name of the images of the pair, and the
last two contain the pair label (1=same/0=different) and whether the pair is
used in a training set (1) or a test set (0).
