			\cbb{Gender Data for Face Images}{2015-2016}{Very rich and extended face database with gender data has been formed combining: Rijksmuseum Art Database, 10k US Adult Faces Database, Labeled faces in the wild and Google image search results on 500 actor and actress names. FischerFaces and Intraface implementations are used for face detection. Resulting hundreds of thousands of images categorized manually.}
			
			\cbb{Database Sorter}{2014-2015}{Database sorter is a software framework with pieces in Matlab, MatConvNet, pretrained C-NN model (imagenet-vgg-f) on ImageNet and Qt. Its purpose is to sort any given raw database of images into text categories specified by the user, with the power of Google image search results.}
			
			\cbb{Hough Forests based Face Detection}{2012}{Project for Data Mining for Visual Media course, Hough Forests architecture is investigated for face detection using OpenCV 2.4.3, Qt 5.0.1. 3000 samples from cropped labeled faces in the wild (LFW) dataset is used for training decision forests. Faces are divided to 16 patches ($4\times4$). Extremely randomized trees are given an objective to classify the face patches. A tiny program is used to generate these trees using a part of the training set and this program is distributed to 14 computers. Each computer generated $500 - 1200$ unique trees and according to their individual and combined performances, each has reached to the generalized error that is proposed by RDF ($40\%$ accuracy on identifying a patch correctly). Finally, probabilistic voting is used to determine the face in the image. 99.37\% performance is reached on Cropped LFW (on remaining 10233 test images) and 70.60\% on 13233 full LFW images.}
				
			\cbb{Random Decision Forests}{2012}{As part of the Data Mining for Visual Media course, a two hours RDF presentation is given to the class, including decision trees, studies that lead to RDF, its algorithm, parameters and advantages, some tricks on its usage, comparisons against SVM and Neural Networks and popular studies.}
			
			\cbb{Home Service Robot}{2012}{Project for Autonomous Robots course using Robot Operating System (ROS), Qt 4.6.4, OpenCV 2.4.2. 10 minutes are given to simultaneously map the environment and position the robot. Afterwards, random requests are given to the robot via control panel to go to drink, where robot requests it, then goes to the visitor. Robot gives requests using speech synthesis module and takes requests using speech recognition. Environment is simulated using Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-Rep), a control panel to handle requests, keep track of the current map, robot position, emergency stop etc. is coded using Qt. Same interface can be used to manually move robot in the map or katana arm (although obstacle avoidance module overrides this control when necessary). OpenCV is used to create the map, visualize it, identify objects of the surrounding (drink, user, door handles). Orocos Kinematics Dynamics (KDL) package is used for arm dynamics to open the doors using robot arm. Rapidly exploring random trees (RRT) is implemented for path finding.}	           	
			
			\cbb{Leaf Recognition}{2011}{Project for Introduction to Image Processing and Computer Vision course, which eventually lead to "Combination of Gross Shape Features, Fourier Descriptors and Multiscale Distance Matrix for Leaf Recognition" study. It recognizes the provided leaves using three separate SVM classifiers trained with respective feature sets and determines the final decision by weighing decisions with cross-validation performances.}
			\vspace{.2in}
			\cbb{Gender Recognition with Random Decision Forests}{2011}{Project for Pattern Recognition course, which eventually lead to a joint study "Facial Feature Selection for Gender Recognition based on Random Decision Forests". Throughout the tests, the number of necessary features that is used on SVM is successfully reduced to half (445 features out of total 832) with 1.4\% performance sacrifice.}
